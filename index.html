                <p>In the past two years, an immense effort by humanitarian partners including UNICEF has helped stabilize the situation for Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who are living in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. But meeting their day-to-day needs is an ongoing challenge, and so is the task of providing for their longer-term needs – especially those related to education. Refugee children and young people are clamouring for more than survival; they yearn for quality education and the opportunity to develop skills that can provide a path to a better future.</p>
